        Web Design Associate Degree  John Tayler Community College
        //May 23, 2022 to Present (part-time). 
        This part-time degree is working very well alongside my recent work experiences. Developing more skills in psychology, and web design from a theoretical perspective while gaining on site experience at work. These classes are online on a part-time basis so they donâ€™t interfere with the time that I have to dedicate to my work.
